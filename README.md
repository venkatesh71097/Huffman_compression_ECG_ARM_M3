# Huffman_compression_ECG_ARM_M3

Referred Geeks for geeks algorithm to write the code. This is the C++ code for high ratio data compression for the 4 ECG module project done using ARM Cortex M3 processor that is scheduled to be tested on 8th July, 2017 @ Healthcare technologies Innovation Centre, IIT Madras on the test cases. Updated a C code for Huffman compression. Gives the output on a screen itself rather than a file, with compression ratio. One of the 3 works done at HTIC during my internship after my sophomore year.

Update: zlib python code is also attached.
